/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * What the bar *does* with the events, rather than what its source says.
 *
 * Four paths open the admin, because each is the only real one somewhere: the right button for the
 * helper's web view, `contextmenu` for a mouse, the taps counted in the page for the panel,
 * `dblclick` for a browser that does synthesise one. The question no reading of the source answers
 * is what happens where two of them are real *at the same time* — a desktop browser, the Chrome
 * kiosk — and the answer used to be two admin windows for one press.
 *
 * So the bar is mounted and the events are dispatched as the real ones arrive, in order.
