# Create the self-signed code-signing identity the helper is built with.
#
# Why: an ad-hoc signature (`codesign --sign -`) changes with every build, and macOS ties its
# Input Monitoring / Accessibility grants to the signature. Without a stable identity, every
# rebuild of the helper drops the permissions you granted the previous one. A self-signed
# certificate in your login keychain fixes the identity once and for all.
#
# The certificate is local, self-signed and trusted for code signing only. It is not an Apple
# Developer ID and cannot be used to distribute anything.
#
# Idempotent: it does nothing when `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` already lists it.
