/**
 * What a widget may do, said in a header rather than left to the iframe.
 *
 * A widget is third-party code. The dashboard runs it in a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe, but
 * that only binds the frame: a browser pointed straight at `/widgets/<id>/index.html` — a link,
 * a redirect, a page opening a window — used to run the widget with the full rights of
 * `http://127.0.0.1:4242`, the origin the WebSocket and the connections API trust. The header
 * travels with the bytes, so it holds wherever the document ends up.
 *
 * `sandbox allow-scripts` without `allow-same-origin` puts the document in an opaque origin:
 * scripts run, but nothing they do counts as coming from us. Everything else is an allow-list of
 * what the widgets in this repository actually need. WebKit does not resolve `'self'` for
 * opaque frames, so the server's loopback origins are listed explicitly for packaged files.
 * `data:`/`blob:` cover what widgets generate, `i.scdn.co` covers album art the local
 * Spotify app hands us as an https URL. No `connect-src` at all: every network call goes through
 * `Fremkit.fetch`, which asks the host, which asks the proxy, which checks the manifest.
