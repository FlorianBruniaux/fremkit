 * the other half, turning that back into a window in front of you.
 *
 * Everything here runs through `execFile` with a fixed argument list — no shell, ever — and every
 * value taken from a session is matched against a pattern first. Not because a shell could eat
 * it (there is none) but because these end up as command-line arguments, and an argument that
 * starts with a dash is a flag. The AppleScripts are constants and take their one variable as
