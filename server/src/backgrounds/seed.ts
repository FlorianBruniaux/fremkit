 * Puts the shipped wallpaper into the user's background library, once.

 * It is copied in as a *file*, not special-cased anywhere: it then appears in the Screen
 * inspector next to anything the user uploaded, can be picked, and can be deleted. Removing it
 * leaves the dashboard with no background at all, which the config already expresses as an
 * absent `display.background` — so there is no hardcoded fallback to fight.
 *
 * Never overwrites: a user who replaced the file with their own keeps theirs. A delete followed
 * by a restart brings the file back, which is harmless — the config no longer references it, so
 * nothing changes on screen; it is simply offered in the library again.
 *
 * Returns true when it copied, for the tests and for nothing else.
 *
 * When `brand/wallpaper/` is not there at all — a release tarball that left it out — nothing is
 * copied and `DEFAULT_CONFIG` still names the image: a fresh install paints no background until
 * the user picks one. Not a reason to refuse to start, but a reason for a release to ship the
 * folder.
