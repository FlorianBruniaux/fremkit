/**
 * What an installed widget is actually allowed to do, as opposed to what it asks for.
 *
 * The manifest on disk is the *ask*: the channels it reads, the commands it sends, the hosts it
 * reaches. The consent record in the config is the *grant*: what the user was shown and accepted
 * on the day it was installed. They agree at that moment and can disagree the moment an update
 * lands — and the update brings the widget's own files, including its manifest, so a manifest
 * left to speak for itself would be a widget granting itself permissions.
 *
 * So everything downstream is handed the intersection. A channel the manifest declares and the
 * consent does not is refused exactly like one that was never declared at all: the bridge host
 * never relays it, the proxy never fetches for it. An update whose permissions grew does nothing
 * new until the user has seen the difference and said yes, and the recorded grant is what says
 * yes — not the presence of the files.
 *
 * Built-ins have no record and need none. They ship with the server, they are reviewed with it,
 * and holding them to a record nothing ever writes would simply break them.
