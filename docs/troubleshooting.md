# Troubleshooting

Most problems are one of three things: a macOS privacy grant that was never given, a grant that
was silently dropped when the helper was rebuilt, or another app holding the touch panel.

"The helper" below is **Fremkit** for the app and **Fremkit Helper** for a source install: the
same program, built two ways (see [Where the data lives](#where-the-data-lives)).

The helper's menu tells you which: it shows state lines such as "Server: running", "Touch: active"
and "Notifications: active" above the toggles, and *Log…* opens the supervised server's output at
`~/Library/Logs/Fremkit/server.log`.

## Quick table

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "Touch: permission missing" | Input Monitoring not granted to *this build* of the helper | Add "Fremkit Helper" under Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring, then relaunch it |
| "Touch: taken by another driver" | Touchscreen Gestures, another driver or a `--probe` run holds the panel | Quit it, and unload its launchd agent so it does not come back |
| "Fence: permission missing" | Accessibility not granted | Add "Fremkit Helper" under Privacy & Security → Accessibility, then relaunch it |
| "Fremkit can't be opened" / "is damaged and can't be opened" | The download was altered or is not the published one | Download the DMG again from the release page; see [Gatekeeper](#gatekeeper) |
| Input Monitoring and Accessibility asked again after moving to the app | The app's Developer ID signature is a new code identity | Expected once; see [The app asks for permissions again](#the-app-asks-for-permissions-again) |
| Permissions reset after every rebuild | Ad-hoc signature: a new code identity each build | Run `scripts/create-signing-identity.sh`, rebuild, grant once more |
| The helper is ticked in Privacy & Security and still has no permission | One stale grant per past ad-hoc identity, which macOS keeps in its cache and matches before the new one | `tccutil reset ListenEvent dev.fremkit.helper && tccutil reset Accessibility dev.fremkit.helper`, relaunch the helper, and accept the two prompts. Removing and re-adding the app in the list does not clear those entries |
| Printer unreachable (`EHOSTUNREACH`) while `ping` and `curl` work | Local Network not granted to the app that runs the server | Allow it under Privacy & Security → Local Network |
| "Server: external" | Something already answers port 4242, so the helper steps aside | Expected under `pnpm dev`; otherwise stop the stray server, or turn *Manage the server* off |

## Gatekeeper

The app and its DMG are signed with the project's Developer ID and notarized by Apple, with the
ticket stapled to both: macOS opens them without a warning and without a network check. A
warning that it "can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software", or that
it "is damaged", means the file is not the one that was published — a truncated download, or a
copy from somewhere else. Delete it and download the DMG again from the
[release page](https://github.com/fdussert/fremkit/releases/latest).

To see what macOS thinks of a copy:

```sh
spctl -a -t exec -vv /Applications/Fremkit.app      # "accepted", "source=Notarized Developer ID"
codesign --verify --strict --verbose=2 /Applications/Fremkit.app
```

Never work around it with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` or by turning Gatekeeper off: the
check is what tells a genuine copy from a modified one.

## The app asks for permissions again

macOS ties Input Monitoring and Accessibility to the code signature. The app is signed with a
Developer ID, the developer helper with the local "Fremkit Helper Dev" certificate: to macOS they
are two different programs that happen to share the bundle id `dev.fremkit.helper`. The first
launch of the app — and the first launch of a signed release after a self-signed build — asks
for both permissions again. Updates keep the same signature, so it happens once.

If the old entry is still ticked and the app still has no permission, the stale grant of the
other signature is matched first. Clear both and accept the prompts once more:

```sh
tccutil reset ListenEvent dev.fremkit.helper
tccutil reset Accessibility dev.fremkit.helper
```

Then open Fremkit again. The same applies to Local Network, which is asked the next time the
server reaches a device on your LAN.

## Where the data lives

| | The app | A source install |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard, connections, backgrounds, installed widgets and themes | `~/Library/Application Support/Fremkit` | the checkout's `data/` |
| Helper settings (`helper.json`) | `~/Library/Application Support/Fremkit` | the same |
| Server log | `~/Library/Logs/Fremkit/server.log` | the same |
| Connection secrets | the login keychain, service `fremkit` | the same |

The app never writes inside itself: its bundle is replaced by every update and its signature
has to stay intact. What decides which server runs is `repoPath` in `helper.json`: present, the
helper runs the checkout's server, exactly as a source install always has; absent, the app runs
the server it carries.

## Moving from a checkout to the app

Nothing moves on its own: a source install keeps working untouched beside a downloaded app, and
the two must not run at the same time (they would fight over the touch panel and port 4242). To
switch:

1. Quit **Fremkit Helper** from its menu bar **F**, and turn its *Launch at login* off first if it
   was on.
2. Copy the dashboard over, if you want to keep it — the app starts empty otherwise:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Fremkit
   rsync -a <checkout>/data/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/Fremkit/
   ```

   Secrets are in the keychain, keyed by connection id, so the copied connections find them.
3. Remove the `"repoPath"` line from `~/Library/Application Support/Fremkit/helper.json`.
4. Move `~/Applications/Fremkit Helper.app` to the Trash.
5. Install and open **Fremkit**, grant the permissions again (see above), and turn *Launch at
   login* back on from its menu.
6. In `~/.claude/settings.json`, point the Claude Code hook and status line at the app (see
   [claude-code.md](claude-code.md)).

Going back is the same in reverse: quit Fremkit, run `pnpm setup` in the checkout (it writes
`repoPath` again and installs the developer helper).

## Removing everything

Quit Fremkit from its menu, turn *Launch at login* off first if it is on, then:

```sh
rm -rf /Applications/Fremkit.app            # or: brew uninstall --zap --cask fremkit
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Fremkit ~/Library/Logs/Fremkit
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/dev.fremkit.helper ~/Library/HTTPStorages/dev.fremkit.helper
rm -rf ~/Library/WebKit/dev.fremkit.helper
defaults delete dev.fremkit.helper
tccutil reset All dev.fremkit.helper
```

The connection secrets stay in the login keychain until you delete them: open Keychain Access
and search for `fremkit`, or `security delete-generic-password -s fremkit` once per secret. If you
added the Claude Code hook, remove its lines from `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## The helper's icon is missing from the menu bar

The helper shows an **F**. If it is not there:

- A menu bar manager (Bartender, Ice, Hidden Bar and the like) may have hidden it. Look in its
  overflow, and move Fremkit to the always-visible section.
- The menu bar may simply be full — macOS drops the rightmost items on a narrow display. Quit a
  few status items and look again.
- The helper may not be running at all. Open it from `~/Applications`; there is no `KeepAlive`, so
  a crash leaves nothing behind.

## Permissions reset every time I rebuild the helper

macOS ties Input Monitoring and Accessibility grants to the code signature. The helper is signed
ad hoc unless a stable code-signing identity exists — and an ad-hoc signature is a *different*
identity on every build, so every rebuild drops the grants you just gave.

`scripts/create-signing-identity.sh` creates a local self-signed "Fremkit Helper Dev" certificate
in your login keychain (`openssl` + `security import` + `security add-trusted-cert -p codeSign`).
It asks for your login password, is idempotent, and is picked up automatically by
`scripts/build-helper.sh`. Another name goes in `FREMKIT_SIGN_IDENTITY`.

Grant the permissions once after that and they survive every rebuild.

Grants only take effect on the **next launch** of the helper: after ticking a box, quit it from
the menu bar and open it again.

## Touch does not work

1. **Input Monitoring.** The driver reads the panel's raw HID reports and cannot open it without
   the grant. The menu says "Touch: permission missing".
2. **Another driver has the panel.** Touchscreen Gestures seizes the touch controller
   exclusively; the helper replaces it, it does not coexist with it. Quitting the app is not
   enough while its launchd agent relaunches it:

   ```sh
   launchctl bootout "gui/$UID" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<its agent>.plist
   ```

   A `--probe` run of the helper does the same thing, so quit the probe too.
3. **Accessibility.** The driver reads the panel itself, but the synthetic mouse and scroll events
   it produces are posted through Accessibility. Without it, touches are read and go nowhere.

`--probe` is the diagnostic: no window, no menu, no synthetic events, just the raw reports and the
decoded gestures on stdout. Quit the helper first, and grant Input Monitoring to your *terminal*
rather than to the bundle.

```sh
"$HOME/Applications/Fremkit Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/FremkitHelper" --probe
```

`x` runs 0 → 16383 left to right and `y` 0 → 9599 top to bottom.

## A LAN device answers `ping` but not Fremkit

macOS 15 and later gate LAN access per application, and the server has no identity of its own: it
runs inside whatever launched it. So the app to allow under System Settings → Privacy & Security →
**Local Network** is:

- **Fremkit Helper**, when the helper manages the server (the normal case);
- **your terminal** (Terminal, iTerm, Ghostty…), when you run `pnpm dev` yourself.

Without the grant, every connection to a LAN device fails as `EHOSTUNREACH`. This is the usual
cause of a Bambu printer or a Homey that looks perfectly reachable.

**Neither `ping` nor `curl` is a witness.** Both are Apple's own binaries and both are exempt from
the filter — on the same address, from the same shell, `curl` answers 200 while Node gets
`EHOSTUNREACH`. So the test that means something is: `ping` or `curl` reaches the device but
**Node** — the server, or a script — does not. That is the grant missing on the app that runs
Node: Fremkit Helper for the live server, your terminal for anything you run yourself.

**After a reinstall the helper may vanish from the Local Network list.** The grant is tied to the
installed bundle, and deleting it drops the grant silently. Reinstall with
`scripts/install-helper.sh`, which replaces the bundle in place, then trigger a LAN connection so
macOS asks again.

## The chamber camera says it is unavailable

- **P1 and A1** serve JPEG frames on port 6000 and need nothing extra.
- **X1 and H2** publish an RTSPS stream on port 322 instead. That needs **ffmpeg** on the machine
  running Fremkit (`brew install ffmpeg`); the tile says so when it is missing.
- The stream also has to be switched on from the printer, under Settings → Camera → **LAN Mode
  Liveview**. With it off the port answers and then refuses the session, and the tile shows its
  placeholder.

See [connections.md](connections.md#the-chamber-camera).

## The calendar widget is empty or stale

- The address must be `https`, at every redirect hop, and must be the **ICS** link — not Outlook's
  HTML one.
- Fremkit re-downloads every five minutes and caps the file at 5 MB. A calendar larger than that
  is refused; publish a narrower one.
- A download that fails keeps the last events on screen and retries. The connection's **Test**
  button gives the real reason — the widget deliberately does not, because the error text can
  quote the address, which is the credential.
- Only the next fortnight is expanded, so a calendar whose next event is further out really is
  empty.

## The admin's file picker does nothing

An older helper build without a `WKUIDelegate`: a web view ignores `<input type="file">` without
one. Rebuild and reinstall the helper.

## The first tap on the dashboard is lost

The click is spent activating an inactive app. Fixed in the kiosk window
(`acceptsFirstMouse`) — rebuild and reinstall the helper.

## Holding the page dots does not open the admin

The long press asks the helper to open its admin window over the `fremkit://admin` URL scheme,
which LaunchServices only knows about once a helper bundle declaring it has been installed.
A helper built before the scheme existed simply ignores the request. Reinstall it:

```sh
pnpm helper:build && pnpm helper:install
```

Then quit the helper from the menu bar **F** and open it again from `~/Applications`. In an
ordinary browser the same press opens `/admin` in a new tab and needs no helper at all.

## The menu says "Server: external"

Something already answers port 4242, so the helper steps aside rather than starting a second one.
That is exactly right under `pnpm dev`. Otherwise stop the stray server, or turn *Manage the
server* off in the menu and run it yourself.

## Red banner in the admin, nothing saves

`data/fremkit.json` is valid JSON that the server cannot interpret, so it runs on defaults and
refuses to save over your file rather than overwriting it. Repair or remove the file — a good copy
may be in `data/fremkit.json.bak`, written when a v1 file was migrated — then restart the server.

## Two admin tabs disagree

Saving is last-writer-wins on the whole configuration: every change is a `PUT /api/config` of the
entire document, grouped over 300 ms. Two tabs open at once will overwrite each other. Close one,
and reload the other.

## Deleting a connection is refused

`DELETE /api/connections/<id>` answers 409 and names the widgets that still point at the
connection. Remove them, or change their `connection` setting first.
