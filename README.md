# Fremkit

Fremkit turns the Corsair Xeneon Edge — a 2560 × 720 touch strip — into a widget dashboard for
your Mac. Pages of tiles show the clock, the machine's load, your calendar, your build pipelines,
your 3D printer, your smart home; you arrange them by dragging them around in a browser-based
admin, and you drive them by touch through a native macOS helper. Widgets are plain HTML folders,
so writing one takes a manifest and an `index.html` — no build step, no framework.

**No iCUE, no third-party driver, no kernel extension.** The helper talks to the Edge's touch
panel over USB HID itself. Quit iCUE and Touchscreen Gestures if you run them — Fremkit
replaces them, it does not sit beside them.

The name is the Fremen survival kit from *Dune*.

## Features

- **Pages** of tiles on a 64 × 16 grid, switched from a navigation bar, with optional
  auto-rotation.
- **A live editor** at `/admin`: the real page rendered with real widgets, drag and resize with
  snapping, overlap refused, keyboard nudges, undo/redo and autosave.
- **Twenty-eight widgets** — clock, weather, a pomodoro timer, CPU, memory, disks, network
  throughput, batteries, processes, volume, Spotify, Dock badges, a clipboard history, shortcut
  buttons, service status checks, published calendars, Claude Code sessions and limits; and,
  *from the registry*, meeting controls, CleanShot X actions, Azure DevOps builds, GitHub
  notifications and Actions, a Bambu Lab printer, Homey devices and flows, a Synology NAS.
  Eighteen ship with Fremkit; the rest are one press away in the admin.
- **Compact widgets** in the navigation bar, with a full-size popover on touch.
- **Per-tile appearance** — background colour, opacity, background image, accent colour and how
  much of the tile the accent paints.
- **Connections** — named credential sets for outside services, with secrets kept in the macOS
  keychain rather than in the config file.
- **A native helper** — a menu bar app that drives the Edge's touch panel with its own HID
  driver, fences the mouse out of the display, shows the dashboard in a kiosk window and
  supervises the server.
- **A widget marketplace** — *Sietch* in the admin installs widgets from a curated registry,
  showing what each one will be allowed to do and asking again when an update wants more.
- **Backup and restore** of the whole dashboard, as a zip that never carries a secret.
- **Themes** — the palette, the fonts and the text size, as a folder with one JSON file: two ship
  with it, four more are on the registry, and yours sits beside them. The dashboard, the editor
  and the widgets all wear the one you pick.
- **Two languages** — the whole interface is French or English, switched in the admin.
- **A widget SDK** that is a folder, a JSON file and an HTML page.
- **Optional local operations** show Docker containers and Ollama/MLX models through registry widgets. See [docs/local-operations.md](docs/local-operations.md).

## Requirements

Nothing from Corsair: no iCUE, no driver. The helper opens the touch panel itself, so iCUE and
Touchscreen Gestures must not be running (the panel takes one owner).

- macOS 13 or later, Apple silicon
- Xcode Command Line Tools (for the helper's Swift build)
- Node 22 or later, and pnpm
- a Corsair Xeneon Edge — everything except the touch driver works on any display
- `jq`, only for the Claude Code status line
- `ffmpeg`, only for the chamber camera of an X1 or H2 printer

## Install

1. **Clone and set up.**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fdussert/fremkit.git
   cd fremkit
   pnpm setup
   ```

   `pnpm setup` checks the prerequisites, installs dependencies, builds the UI and the server,
   offers to create the code-signing identity, then builds and installs the helper into
   `~/Applications` and points it at your checkout. `pnpm setup --check` runs the checks only.

2. **Say yes to the signing identity** when it asks. The helper is signed ad hoc unless a stable
   code-signing identity exists, and macOS ties Input Monitoring and Accessibility grants to the
   signature — so with an ad-hoc signature every rebuild would drop the permissions you just
   granted. `scripts/create-signing-identity.sh` creates a local self-signed "Fremkit Helper Dev"
   certificate in your login keychain. It asks for your login password and is idempotent.

3. **Quit Touchscreen Gestures**, if you use it. It holds the touch controller exclusively, so the
   helper's driver cannot open the panel while it runs — the helper replaces it, it does not
   coexist with it. Quitting the app is not enough while its launchd agent relaunches it:

   ```sh
   launchctl bootout "gui/$UID" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<its agent>.plist
   ```

4. **Grant Input Monitoring.** System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring → add
   "Fremkit Helper". Required to read the touch panel's raw HID reports.

5. **Grant Accessibility.** Same place → Accessibility → add "Fremkit Helper". Required to post
   the synthetic mouse and scroll events the touch driver generates, and to read the Dock's
   badges.

6. **Relaunch the helper** — quit it from the menu bar **F**, then open it again from
   `~/Applications`. Grants only take effect on the next launch.

7. **Allow Local Network** when macOS asks. It asks the first time the server reaches a device on
   your LAN — a Bambu printer, a Homey. The app to allow is "Fremkit Helper".

8. **Launch at login**, optionally, from the menu bar menu. There is no `KeepAlive`: if the helper
   crashes, open it again by hand.

Rebuilding the helper later (`pnpm helper:build && pnpm helper:install`) is what registers changes
to its bundle, including the `fremkit://` URL scheme the dashboard's long press uses to open the
admin window: an older copy ignores it.

The dashboard then opens by itself on the Edge. If you would rather not run the helper at all,
`pnpm start` serves everything and `pnpm kiosk` opens a full-screen Chrome window on the Edge —
you lose the touch driver, the mouse fence and the Dock badges.

## First run

1. **Open the admin** — from the menu bar **F** menu, or at <http://127.0.0.1:4242/admin>.
2. **Add a page** with the **+** in the Pages list, and name it.
3. **Add widgets** — click a card in the widget library to drop it in the first free spot, or drag
   it onto the canvas. Drag it to move it, pull a handle to resize it.
4. **Set it up** — with a widget selected, the right column shows its title, appearance and its
   own settings. A widget that needs a service asks for a connection; create one with
   **Connections** in the top bar.
5. **Switch to Test** to use the widgets for real. Everything saves on its own; the chip in the
   top bar says saved, saving or not saved.

A fresh install starts on one page with a clock and the wallpaper that ships with Fremkit. That
wallpaper is an ordinary entry in the background library, so *Screen → Image → Remove the image*
leaves the screen with no background at all rather than putting it back.

### Editing, in more detail

The admin's middle column is the real page, rendered with live widgets and scaled to fit, with the
navigation bar below it exactly as the Edge shows it.

- **Edit / Test** — in Edit, an overlay captures the mouse: click to select, drag to move, eight
  handles to resize. In Test the overlay steps aside and the widgets are usable, and the preview
  behaves like the screen: a horizontal swipe on the navigation bar or on free board space changes
  page, wrapping around at either end.
- **Keyboard** — arrows move the selection by one cell, Shift+arrows resize it from the south-east corner, Delete or Backspace removes it,
  Cmd+D duplicates it, Escape deselects. Cmd+Z and Cmd+Shift+Z undo and redo anywhere, up to 50
  steps.
- **Left column** — the pages (rename, reorder, duplicate, delete) and the widget library, with a
  rescan button that re-reads the `widgets/` folder without restarting the server. Each card says
  in a line what that widget asks for, so a folder dropped into `widgets/` cannot ask for anything
  quietly.
- **Right column** — *Widget*: title, whether the frame draws it, background, accent, the widget's
  own settings, position and size, and **what the widget asks for** — the channels it reads, the
  ones it can command, the hosts it may reach. *Page*: name and order. *Screen*: language, grid
  (read-only), navigation bar height and opacity, which gesture opens the admin, auto-rotation
  delay, the bar's compact widgets, the screen background, the kiosk URL, backup and restore, and
  privacy.
- **Move to page** — a tile can be sent to another page from the *Widget* tab: it keeps everything
  it carries and lands in the largest free spot there, or the move is refused when nothing fits.
- **Copy settings from…** — where the same widget already exists elsewhere, a drop-down above its
  settings copies the configuration of another of its instances, tile or navigation bar, in one step.
- **Saving** — every change saves on its own, grouped over 300 ms, as a `PUT /api/config` of the
  whole configuration. A refusal shows the message in a toast and reloads from the server. Two
  admin tabs open at once are last-writer-wins.

## Concepts

**Pages.** A dashboard is any number of pages, each a full screen of tiles. You switch between
them by swiping, by tapping the dots in the navigation bar, or automatically after a delay you
set (*auto-rotation*, off by default).

**The grid.** A page is 64 columns by 16 rows of 40 px cells — the Edge's 2560 × 720, less the
navigation bar. A 40 px bar leaves 17 rows instead of 16. Every position and size is in whole
cells: placement snaps to them, and a drop that would leave the screen or overlap a neighbour is
refused with a red ghost rather than silently adjusted.

**Tiles and sizes.** A tile is one instance of a widget, with its own settings, position and size.
Each widget declares a minimum size the editor will not go below and a default size it is dropped
at; between the two the size is free, and a well-written widget reflows.

**Appearance.** Every tile carries its own look: a background colour, an *opacity* from 0 to 1
that lets the screen background show through (0 makes the tile, border included, fully
see-through — the selection outline keeps it findable while editing), a background image with a
dimming overlay, an accent colour, and an *accent mode* saying how much of the tile that accent
paints: **none** leaves it to the widget's own highlights, **frame** colours the title bar and the
border, **fill** colours the whole tile. The screen itself has a background colour and image too.

**The navigation bar.** The strip at the bottom of every page, 80 px or 40 px tall, as opaque as
you like. Its middle is the page dots. Its two sides are free. **Hold the page dots, or double-tap
them, to open the admin** — the Edge has no keyboard, so this is the way in from the screen.
*Screen → Open the admin from the bar* chooses between the two gestures, or accepts both, which
is the default.

**Compact widgets.** Widgets can live *in* the bar, in a left or a right cluster, in the order
you set, as many as fit beside the page dots. A compact rendering is one readable line, as wide
as the widget's manifest asks for and as tall as the bar; the bar is its surface, so it has no
title and no tile of its own. Ten of the built-ins have one: `clock`, `weather`, `pomodoro`,
`cpu`, `memory`, `network`, `battery`, `calendar`, `claude-usage` and `service-status`. Registry
widgets bring their own — `github-inbox`, `homey-devices` and the two Synology ones have one too.

**Full widget on touch.** A bar widget can be marked for a popover: touching it opens the same
widget at its full default size above the bar. It closes on a second touch, on a touch outside it,
on a page change, or after fifteen seconds.

![A compact Claude limits widget in the bar, opened as a full popover above it](docs/images/popover.png)

![The Screen dialog: language, bar height and opacity, and the widgets in the bar](docs/images/admin-screen.png)

**Connections.** A widget that talks to an outside service — Azure DevOps, GitHub, a Bambu
printer, a Homey, a NAS, a published calendar — reads its credentials from a named *connection*,
configured once in the admin and referenced by the widget. The connection types are part of
Fremkit; the widgets for these live on the registry, which is why creating one lists them.
Several widgets can share one, and one service can have several. Non-secret fields live in `data/fremkit.json`; secrets go to the macOS **keychain**
(or, with the `file` backend, to a mode-600 `data/secrets.json`) and are never returned by the
API, logged, written to the config or sent on the WebSocket.

**Language.** French or English, switched in the admin's Screen panel. It changes the interface,
the widget library and the widgets themselves, live, without a reload.

**The helper, or a browser.** The dashboard is a web page: any browser can show it. The native
helper adds what a browser cannot — its own HID driver for the Edge's touch panel, a fence that
keeps the mouse cursor on your other displays, a kiosk window with no chrome and no cursor, the
Dock's notification badges, and supervision of the server. Its menu bar **F** shows what is
running: *Open the admin*, *Admin in the browser*, *Reload the dashboard*, the *Touch* / *Mouse
fence* / *Notifications* / *Manage the server* / *Launch at login* toggles, *Log…* and *Quit*,
above state lines such as "Server: running" and "Touch: active".

### On the sietch

Published on the [widget registry](https://github.com/fdussert/fremkit-sietch) rather than
shipped, because each one only does anything with a printer, a hub, a NAS or an account behind
it. Install them from **Sietch** in the admin’s top bar; the provider or connection type each
one reads is already part of Fremkit, so there is nothing else to set up. A tile placed on a
screen whose widget is not installed offers the install where it stands.

| Widget | Shows | Connection | Compact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ado-pipelines` | Azure DevOps runs in progress and recent history | Azure DevOps | — |
| `bambu-job` | A printer's current job, AMS and chamber camera | Bambu Lab | — |
| `cleanshot` | Big touch buttons for captures, needs [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com) with its URL scheme API allowed | — | — |
| `github-actions` | Running and finished GitHub Actions workflows | GitHub | — |
| `github-inbox` | GitHub notifications, review requests and pull requests | GitHub | ● |
| `homey-devices` | Lights, plugs and sensors of a Homey Pro | Homey Pro | ● |
| `homey-flows` | Buttons that run a Homey Pro's flows | Homey Pro | — |
| `mutedeck` | Meeting controls through MuteDeck | — | — |
| `synology-storage` | Volumes, disk health and temperature of a NAS | Synology | ● |
| `synology-system` | CPU, memory, network and uptime of a NAS | Synology | ● |

## Connections

| Type | Needs | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Azure DevOps | organisation, project, a personal access token with Build (read) | `ado-pipelines` (from the registry) |
| Bambu Lab | IP address, serial number, LAN access code | `bambu-job` (from the registry) |
| GitHub | a personal access token — classic for the notifications, fine-grained enough for reviews, pull requests and Actions — optionally an Enterprise API host | `github-inbox`, `github-actions` (from the registry) |
| Homey Pro | the Homey's address, an API key with Devices and Flows in read and control | `homey-devices`, `homey-flows` (from the registry) |
| ICS calendar | the published calendar address, a colour | `calendar` |
| Synology | the NAS address, a dedicated DSM account in the administrators group (no shared folder, DSM application only) and its password | `synology-storage`, `synology-system` (from the registry) |

How to obtain each credential, what is stored where, and what is never logged:
**[docs/connections.md](docs/connections.md)**.

## Backup

**/admin → Screen → Backup** downloads the whole dashboard — the configuration and the background
library — as `fremkit-backup-<date>.zip`, and **Restore…** takes one back.

Secrets are never in it: they live in the macOS keychain, and the point of keeping them there is
that a file copied to a USB stick does not carry them. Because they are keyed by connection id and
a restore keeps those ids, restoring onto the **same Mac** finds them and everything works at
once; on another Mac the admin lists the connections whose secret has to be entered again.

A restore replaces the dashboard — pages, widgets, connections and backgrounds — and refuses to
write at all while the configuration on disk cannot be read. Details in
**[docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md)**.

## What Fremkit reads on your Mac

Fremkit is a dashboard of your own machine, so several widgets read things that belong to you.
The list is short and it is all of it.

| What | Who reads it | When |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/projects/` — Claude Code's session transcripts | the `claude-sessions` and `claude-usage` widgets, for the session list and the token counts | whenever one of those widgets is on the dashboard |
| The `Claude Code-credentials` keychain item — Claude Code's OAuth token | the account usage behind the `claude-usage` gauges. The token is presented to `api.anthropic.com` and nowhere else; it is never stored, never logged, never in an error message | **off for a new install.** Turn it on in **/admin → Screen → Privacy**. A dashboard that already showed the Claude widget before this setting existed keeps it *on*, so the gauges do not go blank on an upgrade — turn it off there if you would rather. The endpoint (`/api/oauth/usage`) is not documented by Anthropic and may disappear |
| Where a Claude Code session lives — its terminal application, pane and tty, read by the hook inside the session | the `claude-sessions` widget's ↗, to raise that window again | whenever the Claude Code hooks are installed. It stays on the server: the dashboard is told which kind of application it is and what to call it, never the pane key or the tty |
| The clipboard, through `pbpaste` | the `clipboard` widget | whenever that widget is on the dashboard |
| The Dock's badge counts and the icons of installed applications | the `notifications` and `shortcuts` widgets, through the helper | whenever one of those widgets is on the dashboard |
| The volume, the battery, the disks, the processes, the network | those widgets, through `pmset`, `df`, `ps` and friends | whenever one of them is on the dashboard |

Everything else Fremkit knows, you typed into it: the connections of the table above, whose
secrets live in the macOS keychain (see [docs/connections.md](docs/connections.md)). Nothing is
sent to any server other than the ones you configured, there is no telemetry, and the server
listens on `127.0.0.1` only.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Touch: permission missing" | Grant Input Monitoring to "Fremkit Helper", then relaunch it |
| "Touch: taken by another driver" | Quit Touchscreen Gestures and unload its launchd agent |
| Permissions reset after every rebuild | Run `scripts/create-signing-identity.sh` and rebuild |
| A LAN device answers `ping` but not Fremkit | Allow Local Network for the app running the server |
| "Server: external" | Something else answers port 4242 — expected under `pnpm dev` |
| A shortcut button to a NAS or a router has no icon | Expected: favicons of private and local addresses are not fetched. The button still works |
| The admin shows an old version of itself | Reopen it, or Cmd+R in its window; it keeps one web view for the helper's lifetime |
| Widgets break after pulling a new version | Restart the server: the widget bridge is read once, at start |

The rest, with the reasoning: **[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)**.

## Development

```sh
pnpm dev          # server on 4242 + Vite on 5173 (dashboard http://localhost:5173, admin /admin)
pnpm build        # ui + server
pnpm start        # production: http://127.0.0.1:4242 and /admin
pnpm test         # vitest, server + ui
pnpm typecheck
pnpm helper:build   # native/dist/Fremkit Helper.app
pnpm helper:install
pnpm helper:test
```

| Folder | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `server/` | Fastify 5 on 127.0.0.1:4242 — config, widget catalog, providers, connections, secrets, the bridge, the WebSocket |
| `ui/` | Vue 3 — the dashboard, the admin, and the code they share |
| `native/` | The Swift helper — kiosk window, HID touch driver, mouse fence, admin window, Dock badges, server supervision |
| `widgets/` | One folder per widget |
| `scripts/` | Setup, dev, the helper's build and tests, the signing identity, kiosk, the Claude Code hooks |
| `data/` | Your configuration and its assets. Git-ignored |
| `brand/` | Icon, menu bar glyph, favicons, social image — see [brand/README-assets.md](brand/README-assets.md) |
| `docs/` | This documentation |

A second checkout can run beside a live one by giving it another port: `FREMKIT_PORT=4301 pnpm start`.
`FREMKIT_DATA_DIR=/tmp/fremkit-fresh pnpm start` points the config, the background library and the
caches somewhere else — a from-scratch install on the live checkout, without moving anything
aside. Your keychain secrets are keyed by connection id, so a fresh config never names them.
