     Whether a running process is the server this launch starts. It guards the kill of an orphan
     named by a stale pid file: pids are recycled, and the pid may belong to anything by now.

     A checkout's child is `node …/tsx/… src/index.ts` from the repo, so its `commandLine` (as
     `ps -o command=` prints it) must carry both the repo path and the entry point; either alone
     matches far too much. A bundled child is the bundle's own executable, so its
     `executablePath` — the kernel's, from `proc_pidpath`, with symlinks resolved — must be that
     file exactly. `resourcesPath` has to be resolved the same way for the comparison to hold
     (`/tmp` is `/private/tmp`, and `ps` prints whichever spelling the process was started with).
     An empty path never matches: `contains("")` is true for everything.

     The child's environment, built from the helper's own.

     A login item inherits a bare `PATH`, so the usual Homebrew places are added in front: the
     server runs tools such as `ffmpeg` from there. The checkout also gets its `node_modules/.bin`.

     The bundled server is told where it is (`FREMKIT_ROOT`) and where the user's data lives
     (`FREMKIT_DATA_DIR`), since it has no checkout to find a `data/` folder in. `NODE_OPTIONS` is
     dropped for it: a user's `--require` or `--inspect` meant for their own Node has no business
     in the app's.

     `scanner` is the disk map's `fremkit-scan`, which ships beside the helper's executable in
     both setups. The server runs it by this absolute path, and falls back to `du` without it;
     nothing goes on `PATH`.
